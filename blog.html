            <hr />
            <p>
                Wow, hello and we are here! There has been a <b>HEFTY</b> amount of work this past month in order for me to get to the point where I feel comfortable enough to post. Most of that comfortability stems from the amount of work
                I have to show for the upcoming role playing game, Alibe: Libb Like Me. I am working TIRELESSLY behind my closed door to bring the world a gift they did not know was on the way. Feel free to relate me to Santa Claus. I can
                confirm, I have been compared.
            </p>
            <h4>So, Who am I?</h4>
            <p>
                Allow me to take you to a far far off land known as <small>Minnesota</small>, and in this land resides yours truly, the creator of <em>Alibe: Libb Like me</em>! You can call me, Mortapolis. I am a very passionate person that
                finds ways to express myself with positivity and upliftment of those around me and everyone with arts, relativity, and projects that lead to the communities enjoyment! I have recently started programming and coding and I
                have taken up this project to encourage my family, encourage my partner and encourage the life that I live through positivity and enjoyment, still productivity, and creating this video game which is why I am now creating
                this blog to communicate with all of you on a monthly basis to let you know how that updates going. This is the very first one coming out, hopefully it is October 11th and you are reading this and it is October 11th. If not,
                oh well nice to see you here anyway!!
            </p>
            <h4>More about that communication?</h4>
            <p>
                I will continue to send out a blog post every month on the 11th. In these blog posts, I will be sending pictures, sometimes videos or animations, of the project so far and keep you all very in touch with how the video game
                development is going and exactly what I am doing with all of the time that I have and do not have to make the video game. There will be a lot of different questions, errors, and overall bugs that I will have to overcome;
                feel free to comment on them or let me know a better way or a more efficient way to get to the project because, in the end of this my goal is to finish this game as quickly as possible so I can put it out to the hands of the
                world to folks like you and from there continue updating it so I can make it better for you. This is a really, really powerful idea and mode of entertainment, and source of learning that I think all of us will be able to
                benefit from and, hopefully you all will see that on the first demo, which is scheduled right now to release at the start of January 2023 a little find information for those there.
            </p>
            <p>
                OK so that is a bit about me. Let is get back to the game and I will give you more tidbits of information on me in future blog posts as well. I will be posting about 12 times a year, maybe extra for holidays seasons or if I
                am feeling extra festival but overall I am going to try and keep that 12 times a year or once a month ratio on the 11th and fill that in with information to make sure I do not really have to give it another post in the month
                and give you a strong idea of what has been done so far, unless I specify. Let us get into some updates of the game now!
            </p>

            <h4>Project So Far:</h4>
            <p>
                Currently I am working to finish the website that this blog should be on so I suppose by the time of posting this blog, I wisll be uploading the website, if that makes sense. I am working to finish all of the creatures, the
                classes or roles the player may be able to experience. The definitions of the classes have been completed as well as the mechanics of the game. Now I am really illustrating the game and the files of the game to show what the
                functions of the player experience will be. I am also working to complete all of the seed indexes for all of the farming and edible items, including potions, and spell catalyst ingredients with that, and I have not yet
                started the programming aspect, really, of it which is why I do not have any of the footage of any animation. I want to make sure all the artwork is done so when the programming part is completed the combination of the two
                flows very easily and the final portion will be me taking images and putting them into the code. Hopefully at that point onward the completion to release will be me debugging all of the programming portion of the game and
                finally releasing it December 14th.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think trying to code and Animate at the same time would end up forcing the game to push itself beyond the patience of ambition so with that it is as I am anticipating to be done with all the animations by December the end
                of the year I would say go ahead and say so I may December 11 post you are definitely be getting a lot of different pictures of all of the different artworks that we have also shout out to aspirate to all the artwork and
                animations feel free to send me different things to uplift you through this because I know well definitely give you a strong name afterwards for this and mentions through that. I will also be using it using unity to D2 Run
                the game overall, I took a lot of encouragement from Stardew valley and I saw a lot of the different methods languages in definitions that were used to engineer that and it, though there are some parts that I intend to
                improve as well for example, the trees, I will give a lot more into it attention to the trees to make them more alive make them more free and pets you know this is not this is not a game to call anything anyone out it is a
                game to accumulate all that we have and make it better and make it more fun because I think the biggest part of what I have learned about programming is This is something that we have all been working towards and if we
                disregard what we have all been working towards then we are going to be missing about 90% of the information that makes this process go so efficiently so with that until November 11 actually my birthday, so feel free to send
                me some birthday treats like some Cards I love snickers they are really good and I will see you all next time and have a wonderful Sun!
